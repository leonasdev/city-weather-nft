<h1 align="center">üèûÔ∏èCity Weather NFT</h1>
This project is a smart contract for a dynamic NFT. The token starts as an Earth when initially minted. However, whenever the token is transferred to another address, it will randomly select a city and transform its appearance based on the weather conditions of that city.

## üöÄGetting Started
1. Clone the project
    - `git clone https://github.com/leonasdev/city-weather-nft`
2. Install dependencies
    - `pnpm install`
3. Compile contracts
    - `pnpm compile`
4. Setting the `.env` file
    - Adjust values in `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
5. Deploy contract to sepolia test network
    - `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia`
6. Minting token
    - ```typescript
      const contractAddress = "0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"; // replace it with contract address
      const DNFT = await ethers.getContractFactory("CityWeatherNFT");
      const dnft = DNFT.attach(contractAddress);
      console.log("Minting...");
      await dnft.mint();
      console.log("Done.");
      ```
    - `npx hardhat run scripts/index.ts --network sepolia`
7. Checking your NFT
    - Import nft contract in Matamask to observe your NFT token
    - **Token ID must start with** `1`
8. Fund contract LINK token
    - See: https://docs.chain.link/resources/fund-your-contract#send-funds-to-your-contract
    - Funding `3` LINK should enough (can withdraw latter)
9. Transfer your NFT token to another accoount
10. Waitting for fulfillment
    - You can check status of request by:
      ```typescript
      const contractAddress = "0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"; // replace it with contract address
      const DNFT = await ethers.getContractFactory("CityWeatherNFT");
      const dnft = DNFT.attach(contractAddress);
      console.log("Last request status:");
      console.log(await dnft.s_requests(await dnft.requestIds(await dnft.lastRequestId())));
      ```
    - `npx hardhat run scripts/index.ts --network sepolia`
    - Wait `fulfilled` to `true`

11. Checking your NFT in another account
    - You need import NFT contract again in another account
12. Observe that NFT transform its appearance!
13. Withdraw your LINK token
    - ```typescript
      const contractAddress = "0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"; // replace it with contract address
      const DNFT = await ethers.getContractFactory("CityWeatherNFT");
      const dnft = DNFT.attach(contractAddress);
      await dnft.withdrawLink();
      ```
    - `npx hardhat run scripts/index.ts --network sepolia`
